# Human Gramophone

Human gramophone is a service provided by live music clubs. It consists in giving customers an opportunity to pick a vinyl from the club's collection and ask the band to play it.

It's fictitious for now, but wouldn't it be great to have such a service at your beloved club?

Features to be developed:

• a booking user form ;
• an option of adding favorite vinyls to the wishlist .
